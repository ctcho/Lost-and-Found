Notes:

- This is a "Lost and Found" web application that uses Ruby on Rails.
  * Ruby version: 2.3.1
  * Rails version: 5.0.2

- It only has basic searches for sample items in its database. You can search for items
based on the following:
  * Item Title
  * Item Description
  * Item Category ID

- An odd bug: you must type in the URL path of the search page directly in order for
it to actually search. If you click to it from another page, you can fill in the search
fields, but it won't actually submit. I'm not sure why this is.

- It has no tests as of yet.
